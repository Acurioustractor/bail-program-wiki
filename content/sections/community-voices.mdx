# Community Voices & Insights

The BAIL Program is driven by the voices and experiences of our community. Here you will find perspectives from Elders who guide us, young people who have been transformed, and families who have witnessed the change.

## Elder Wisdom & Guidance

Our Elders provide the cultural foundation and wisdom that guides everything we do. Their voices carry the authority of tradition and the power of lived experience. They are the cornerstone of our program's cultural integrity.

### Uncle Malcolm - Kalkadoon Elder & Cultural Advisor
*"Country teaches what no classroom can. When these young fellas come out bush with us, they start to understand who they are. The land holds our stories, our laws, our healing. This program, it is bringing our kids home to themselves."*

### Aunty Margaret - Traditional Knowledge Holder
*"These young ones, they have been lost in the whitefella world. But when they sit by the fire, listen to the old stories, learn the old ways - that is when the healing starts. Brodie, he understands this. He is doing good work."*

### Uncle James - Cultural Teaching Elder
*"The old people, we knew how to raise strong kids. This program, it brings back the old ways - teaching respect, responsibility, connection to Country. The young people, they hungry for this knowledge."*

## Young Voices

The young people who participate in our program are the real proof of its effectiveness. Their stories of transformation inspire us and guide our approach. These are their voices, their journeys, their truth.

### Jordan T. - Program Participant, Age 16
*"Before this program, I was angry all the time. Did not know where I belonged. Now I know my mob, my country. Brodie showed me I can be strong without hurting people. I want to help other kids like me now."*

### Kylie C. - Program Graduate, Now Youth Mentor
*"I was in and out of trouble for years. The camps changed everything. Learning to fish with Uncle, hearing the stories around the fire, training with Brodie - it all made sense. Now I am helping run the program for other kids."*

### Marcus W. - Program Participant, Age 15
*"My family was worried about me getting into gangs. The camp showed me there is another way to be tough - through culture, through fitness, through helping your people. I am proud of who I am now."*

## Family Voices

The program impact extends beyond individual participants to their families and communities. Parents and siblings witness profound changes that strengthen family bonds and restore hope for the future.

### Sarah M. - Mother of Program Participant
*"I did not know my son anymore before this program. He was angry, getting into trouble. After the camps, he started talking to me again, helping around the house. He found himself out there on Country."*

### David K. - Father and Community Leader
*"This program gives our kids what we sometimes cannot - connection to their culture in a strong, positive way. Brodie and the Elders, they are doing what we all wish we could do for our young people."*

### Linda T. - Grandmother and Traditional Owner
*"My grandson came back from camp different. He wanted to learn language, asked me about the old stories. For the first time in years, he was proud to be blackfella. That is worth everything."*
