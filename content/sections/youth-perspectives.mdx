# Young Voices

The young people who participate in our program are the real proof of its effectiveness. Their stories of transformation inspire us and guide our approach. These are their voices, their journeys, their truth.

## Jordan T. - Program Participant, Age 16

*"Before this program, I was angry all the time. Didn't know where I belonged. Now I know my mob, my country. Brodie showed me I can be strong without hurting people. I want to help other kids like me now."*

**Background**: Jordan came to the program through youth justice referral after multiple incidents. Through cultural connection and mentoring, he discovered his identity and purpose.

## Kylie C. - Program Graduate, Now Youth Mentor

*"I was in and out of trouble for years. The camps changed everything. Learning to fish with Uncle, hearing the stories around the fire, training with Brodie - it all made sense. Now I'm helping run the program for other kids."*

**Journey**: From program participant to youth mentor, Kylie now helps facilitate sessions and supports new participants through their own transformation.
