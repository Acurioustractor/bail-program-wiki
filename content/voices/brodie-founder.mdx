I started this program because I saw too many of our young people lost in the system, disconnected from their culture and their identity. The BAIL Program isn't just about keeping kids out of jail - it's about bringing them home to themselves, to their culture, to their community. When a young person connects with their ancestral wisdom, learns from our Elders, and finds their place on Country, everything changes. That's the power of cultural healing.
