## Partner Communities

We work closely with Indigenous communities across the region to ensure culturally appropriate and community-driven programming.

Community partnerships include:

- Cultural centers and museums
- Educational institutions
- Health and wellness organizations

Each partnership is built on mutual respect, shared values, and commitment to Indigenous youth success.
