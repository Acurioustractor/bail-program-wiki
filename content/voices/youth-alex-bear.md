"Before BAIL, I felt disconnected from my culture and struggled with confidence. The program changed everything. Learning traditional skills while developing leadership abilities showed me I could be proud of who I am while achieving my dreams. Now I mentor other youth and am pursuing my goal of becoming a social worker to help my community."
