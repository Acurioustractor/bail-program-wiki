# Elder Wisdom & Guidance

Our Elders provide the cultural foundation and wisdom that guides everything we do. Their voices carry the authority of tradition and the power of lived experience. They are the cornerstone of our program's cultural integrity.

## Uncle Malcolm - Kalkadoon Elder & Cultural Advisor

*"Country teaches what no classroom can. When these young fellas come out bush with us, they start to understand who they are. The land holds our stories, our laws, our healing. This program, it's bringing our kids home to themselves."*

## Aunty Margaret - Traditional Knowledge Holder

*"These young ones, they've been lost in the whitefella world. But when they sit by the fire, listen to the old stories, learn the old ways - that's when the healing starts. Brodie, he understands this. He's doing good work."*
