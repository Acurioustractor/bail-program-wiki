- **Storytellers** - Passing down oral traditions and family histories
- **Healers** - Supporting emotional and spiritual wellness
- **Leaders** - Modeling Indigenous leadership and values

## Elder Teachings

Throughout the program, Elders share teachings on:
- Traditional land-based practices
- Cultural protocols and ceremonies  
- Language preservation
- Family and community responsibilities
- Spiritual practices and beliefs
- Historical knowledge and experiences

## Creating Sacred Space

Elders help create sacred learning environments where youth feel safe to explore their identity, ask questions, and connect with their heritage in meaningful ways.
