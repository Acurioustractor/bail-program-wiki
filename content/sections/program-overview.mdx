# Mission Statement

The **BAIL (Be An Indigenous Leader) Program**, delivered through the innovative CAMPFIRE model, represents a transformative approach to addressing youth crime and disconnection among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people in Mount Isa and Doomadgee.

Led by Brodie Germaine Fitness (BG Fit), this culturally-grounded initiative combines the healing power of Country with fitness, mentoring, and Elder guidance to break cycles of disadvantage and empower young Indigenous leaders.
