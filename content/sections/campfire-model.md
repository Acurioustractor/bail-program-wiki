# ðŸ”¥ The CAMPFIRE Framework

Our innovative framework combines eight key elements that work together to create transformative experiences for young Indigenous people. Each element of CAMPFIRE works together like the components of a traditional campfire - each piece is essential, and together they create something powerful and transformative.

## The Eight Elements

### **C** - Culture
**Deep immersion in traditional practices and knowledge systems**

Participants engage with traditional Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander practices, learning about their cultural heritage, customs, and spiritual connections to Country.

### **A** - Ancestral Wisdom  
**Learning from Elders and traditional knowledge holders**

Direct mentorship from respected Elders who share ancient wisdom, traditional stories, and cultural protocols that have been passed down through generations.

### **M** - Mentoring
**One-on-one guidance from culturally strong role models**

Individualized support from Indigenous mentors who understand the challenges young people face and can provide culturally appropriate guidance.

### **P** - Personal Growth
**Individual development and self-discovery**

Fostering self-awareness, confidence, and personal development through structured activities and reflective practices.

### **F** - Fitness
**Physical health as foundation for overall wellness**

Comprehensive fitness programs that build physical strength, endurance, and overall health as a foundation for mental and emotional wellbeing.

### **I** - Identity
**Strengthening cultural identity and sense of belonging**

Helping young people understand and embrace their Indigenous identity, fostering pride in their heritage and sense of belonging to community.

### **R** - Resilience
**Building capacity to overcome challenges and trauma**

Developing coping strategies, emotional regulation skills, and the inner strength to overcome adversity and break cycles of disadvantage.

### **E** - Empowerment
**Developing leadership and community contribution capacity**

Fostering leadership skills, community engagement, and the confidence to make positive contributions to family and community.

## The CAMPFIRE Method

Like a traditional campfire that brings people together for warmth, light, and connection, our framework creates a sacred space where young Indigenous people can:

- **Reconnect** with their cultural heritage and identity
- **Heal** from trauma and disconnection  
- **Learn** from Elders and traditional knowledge
- **Grow** in confidence and capability
- **Transform** their lives and communities
