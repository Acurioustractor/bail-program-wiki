# The CAMPFIRE Strategic Framework

The CAMPFIRE model is the foundation of the BAIL Program, representing eight interconnected pillars that address the holistic development of Indigenous youth.

## The Eight Pillars

### 🏛️ **Culture**
Connecting youth to their Indigenous heritage through traditional ceremonies, storytelling, and cultural practices. Participants learn about their ancestral traditions and develop pride in their cultural identity.

### 👴 **Ancestral Wisdom**
Learning from traditional knowledge systems and the teachings of Elders. This pillar ensures that ancient wisdom is passed down to the next generation while being applied to modern challenges.

### 🤝 **Mentoring**
Guidance from Indigenous leaders, Elders, and successful community members. Each participant is paired with mentors who provide ongoing support and role modeling.

### 🌱 **Personal Growth**
Individual development journey focusing on self-awareness, goal-setting, and personal responsibility. Youth explore their strengths and develop life skills.

### 💪 **Fitness**
Physical health and outdoor activities including traditional games, wilderness skills, and modern fitness practices. Building strong bodies and healthy lifestyle habits.

### 🪶 **Identity**
Strengthening cultural identity and sense of belonging within the Indigenous community. Youth develop a strong understanding of who they are and where they come from.

### 🛡️ **Resilience**
Building strength to overcome challenges and bounce back from adversity. Developing coping strategies and emotional regulation skills.

### ⚡ **Empowerment**
Developing leadership capabilities and confidence to create positive change in their communities. Youth become agents of transformation.

## How CAMPFIRE Works

Each element of CAMPFIRE is woven throughout the 10-day program experience, creating a comprehensive approach to youth development that honors Indigenous values while preparing youth for success in the modern world.
