#### Aunty Margaret
- **Role**: Traditional Knowledge Holder
- **Category**: Elder Wisdom & Guidance
- **Testimonial**: "These young ones, they've been lost in the whitefella world. But when they sit by the fire, listen to the old stories, learn the old ways - that's when the healing starts. Brodie, he understands this. He's doing good work."

### Youth Perspectives

#### Jordan T.
- **Role**: Program Participant, Age 16

#### Kylie C.
- **Role**: Program Graduate, Now Youth Mentor
- **Category**: Youth Perspectives
