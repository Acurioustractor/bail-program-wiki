# The CAMPFIRE Framework

Our innovative framework combines eight key elements that work together to create transformative experiences for young Indigenous people. Each element of CAMPFIRE works together like the components of a traditional campfire - each piece is essential, and together they create something powerful and transformative.

## The Eight Elements

### C - Culture
Deep immersion in traditional practices and knowledge systems. Participants engage with traditional Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander practices, learning about their cultural heritage, customs, and spiritual connections to Country.

### A - Ancestral Wisdom
Learning from Elders and traditional knowledge holders. Direct mentorship from respected Elders who share ancient wisdom, traditional stories, and cultural protocols that have been passed down through generations.

### M - Mentoring
One-on-one guidance from culturally strong role models. Individualized support from Indigenous mentors who understand the challenges young people face and can provide culturally appropriate guidance.

### P - Personal Growth
Individual development through structured activities and reflection. Participants work on building self-awareness, emotional regulation, goal-setting, and life skills through culturally informed approaches.

### F - Fitness
Physical foundation through traditional and contemporary activities. Combining traditional movement practices with modern fitness approaches to build physical strength, coordination, and healthy lifestyle habits.

### I - Identity
Cultural identity strengthening and pride development. Helping young people understand their place in their family, community, and cultural traditions while building confidence in their Indigenous identity.

### R - Resilience
Overcoming challenges through traditional coping strategies. Learning from traditional approaches to dealing with adversity while building modern resilience skills for contemporary challenges.

### E - Empowerment
Leadership development and community contribution. Building skills and confidence to become leaders in their communities and positive role models for other young people.
