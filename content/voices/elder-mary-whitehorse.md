"When I see these young ones come to camp, many have lost their way. But after ten days in the wilderness, learning the old ways alongside the new, they walk taller. They know who they are. The CAMPFIRE framework honors our ancestors while preparing our youth for the modern world. This is how we ensure our culture survives and thrives."
