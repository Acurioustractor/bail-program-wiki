# ðŸŽ¯ Mission Statement

**The BAIL (Be An Indigenous Leader) Program**, delivered through the innovative CAMPFIRE model, represents a transformative approach to addressing youth crime and disconnection among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people in Mount Isa and Doomadgee.

Led by Brodie Germaine Fitness (BG Fit), this culturally-grounded initiative combines the healing power of Country with fitness, mentoring, and Elder guidance to break cycles of disadvantage and empower young Indigenous leaders.

### M - Mentoring: One-on-one guidance

### P - Personal Growth: Individual development

### F - Fitness: Physical foundation

### I - Identity: Cultural identity

### R - Resilience: Overcoming challenges

### E - Empowerment: Leadership development
